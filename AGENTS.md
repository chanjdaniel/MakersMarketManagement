# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Branch Model

- `dev` is the default/integration branch: all feature PRs target `dev`.
- `main` is the deploy-only branch: it auto-deploys, and is reached ONLY by promoting `dev` → `main` as a deliberate, versioned release.
- Never commit directly to `main`. Never open PRs targeting `main` (except the release-please Release PR, which is automated).

## Release Process

- Release management uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) (GitHub Action `googleapis/release-please-action@v5`).
- Release type is `simple` (conventional-commits-driven; no per-language package file parsing).
- Workflow triggers on push to `main` (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`).
- When `dev` is promoted to `main`, release-please opens a Release PR with version bump + CHANGELOG.
- Merging the Release PR creates a git tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`) and a GitHub Release.
- All commits MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.).
- Baseline seed: `0.0.0` in `.release-please-manifest.json`; the first release is pinned to `v0.1.0` via `release-as: 0.1.0` in `release-please-config.json`. Remove that `release-as` field after `v0.1.0` ships, after which versions follow conventional commits (`feat:` → minor, `fix:` → patch, breaking → major).
- Full release docs: `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## Tech Stack

- Front-end: Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript (in `front-end/`), PrimeVue UI components, Pinia state management.
- Back-end: Python 3.11 / Flask + MongoDB (in `back-end/`).
- Testing: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e) for front-end; pytest for back-end.
- CI: `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs on `dev` and `main` for both PRs and pushes.

## E2E Testing Patterns

- **data-testid convention**: `viewname-element` (e.g. `login-email-input`, `markets-create-button`).
  No product behavior changes - purely additive test infrastructure.
- **Page Object Model**: Located under `front-end/e2e/pages/`.
  Each page object wraps Playwright `getByTestId()` selectors and exposes action methods.
  New pages should follow the existing `LoginPage`, `NewMarketPage`, `MarketSetupPage`,
  `AssignmentResultsPage`, `OrganizationsPage`, `ManageMarketPage` patterns.
- **Fixtures**: `front-end/e2e/fixtures.ts` provides `TEST_USER`, `authenticatedPage`,
  re-exports page objects for convenience, and exposes `BACKEND_URL`
  (via `detectBackendPort()`) for direct API calls.
- **API-level seeding**: `front-end/e2e/helpers/seeds.ts` exports `seedMarketWithVendors()`
  which creates markets and uploads vendor CSV via the back-end API.
  `front-end/e2e/helpers/seedAssignedMarket.ts` exports `seedAssignedMarket()`, which
  also configures the market `setupObject` and triggers assignment via the API.
  Requires a verified test user (created by `scripts/seed_fixture.sh`).
- **Markets require an organization**: `POST /markets` rejects a payload with no
  `organizationId`, an unknown organization, or an organization the caller is not a
  member of (400 each).
  Anything that creates a market must therefore attach one: `seeds.ts` exports
  `ensureTestOrgAuthenticated()` (already-logged-in request context) and
  `ensureTestOrg()` (logs in first), both of which reuse the user's first organization
  or create `E2E Test Org`, and the seed helpers return it as `orgId`.
  Specs that create a market through the UI must call `ensureTestOrg()` in `beforeAll`,
  otherwise the overlay's org dropdown is empty and submit stays disabled.
- **Test user creation**: The back-end `/register-user` endpoint does NOT set `email_verified`,
  so users created through it cannot log in.
  Test users must be created via `back-end/create_test_user.py` which sets `email_verified=True`.
  `scripts/seed_fixture.sh` creates two verified users: `TEST_EMAIL` (owns `Seed Test Org`)
  and `NO_ORG_EMAIL` (`e2e-noorg@example.com`), which is deliberately left in no organization
  so `new-market-org.spec.ts` can exercise the zero-org fallback.
  A spec needing users beyond those two calls `ensureVerifiedUser()`
  (`front-end/e2e/helpers/verifiedUser.ts`) in `beforeAll`, which runs that same script inside
  the back-end container; do not hand-roll the user document, and do not switch to
  `/register-user`.
- **Run E2E**: `./scripts/seed_fixture.sh` then `cd front-end && npm run test:e2e`.
  Playwright config auto-detects worktree port via `detectFrontendPort()`.

### Floorplan Workflow E2E

- **Deterministic - no AI mocking needed.** Despite the "Floorplan AI" name,
  the front-end wizard makes no LLM/vision calls. Table auto-placement
  (`POST /floorplans/place-tables`, `back-end/services/placement_service.py`)
  is a pure geometry solver (Shapely + `pyckingsolver`). The
  Gemini/GPT vision endpoint (`POST /floorplans/analyze`,
  `back-end/api/floorplans_analysis.py`) exists but is not wired into the
  front-end workflow (walls are drawn by hand). Consequence: the flow can be
  exercised end-to-end for real in CI with no API keys and no stubbing.
- **Konva canvas interactions and coverage gap.** The wizard's three canvas
  steps have different testability:
  - Calibration line drawing IS drivable with real Playwright `page.mouse`
    drags on the Konva stage (see `FloorplanWorkflowPage.drawCalibrationLine()`).
  - Section-grouping (Konva "lasso" selection) and the `FloorplanEditor` step
    are NOT reliably drivable via simulated mouse events.
    `floorplan.spec.ts` drives Pinia store state directly via `page.evaluate`
    for those steps (`groupAllTablesIntoSection()`), and uses
    `snapshotPlacedTables()` to assert table state persists across wizard steps.
  - **Coverage gap**: section grouping and editor canvas interactions are
    validated at the state level, not as real user gestures. Anyone extending
    floorplan coverage should account for this.
- **Artifacts** (PR #18 pattern to follow):
  - Page object: `front-end/e2e/pages/FloorplanWorkflowPage.ts`
  - Spec: `front-end/e2e/floorplan.spec.ts`
  - Fixture: `front-end/e2e/fixtures/test-floorplan.png` (800×600 PNG)
- **Save-path null-tolerance**: `POST /floorplans/save-to-market`
  (`back-end/api/floorplans_save.py`) handles a null `setupObject` on the
  market doc (the manual-setup path leaves it null). The fix uses
  `isinstance(existing_setup, dict)` to branch between updating the existing
  object and seeding a fresh one.
- **Editor-mount table preservation**: `FloorplanEditor.vue`'s
  `loadBackgroundImage()` only calls `store.initFloorplan()` when no floorplan
  exists yet, spreading the existing store data (`placedTables`, `tableTypes`,
  `sections`, `walls`, `obstacles`, scale) into the init so forward wizard
  progression keeps auto-placed tables; when a floorplan already exists it just
  refreshes the background image fields. This replaced an earlier
  snapshot/restore workaround in the e2e page object.

## E2E Seed Helpers for Published Markets

- `seedPublishedMarketWithAssignments()` in `front-end/e2e/helpers/seeds.ts` creates a fully
  published market with vendor assignments ready for check-in, vendor browsing, and table filtering tests.
- The back-end assignment algorithm (`assign_market`) requires `enum_priority_order` to have one
  entry (empty list) per column in `col_names`. Omitting this causes an `IndexError`.
- Publishing is `POST /markets/{id}/transition` with `{ toPhase: 'archived' }`, never a PUT of
  `isDraft: false` - `isDraft` is derived from `phase` and a PUT body cannot set it.
- After publishing, with a configured `setup_object`, you must fetch the
  computed assignment via `GET /markets/{id}/assignment` and store it back via PUT.
  The stored `assignmentObject.vendorAssignments` is what `record_attendance` reads at check-in time.

## CSV Field Runtime Coupling (Conventioner sharp edge)

- `col_name` and `col_name_idx` on `MarketDateObject` (in `back-end/datatypes.py`) are
  used at runtime in two places that CANNOT be removed until Phase 5 of Conventioner:
  - `back-end/api/attendance.py:67-75` - `record_attendance()` builds date aliases from
    `md.get("col_name")`. Without it, public check-in for existing markets breaks.
  - `back-end/assignment/assignment.py:53` - `_calculate_date_flexibility()` resolves
    dates via `market_date.col_name`. Without it, the solver fails for existing markets.
- These fields are kept Optional with `None` defaults on the Pydantic models during
  Phases 1-4. New application-based markets leave them `None`. Existing CSV-backed
  markets retain their values.
- The same backward-compat strategy applies to the other CSV-derived fields on
  `SetupObject`, `PriorityObject`, and `AssignmentOptionObject`: keep them Optional,
  remove them in Phase 5 when the solver adapter and attendance redesign land.
- Do NOT delete `is_draft` from the `Market` model, and do not make it writable again. It is a
  `@computed_field` derived strictly from `phase` (true iff `phase == draft`), kept on the
  document only because it is the fallback `phase_from_market_document()` uses for a market
  written before `phase` existed. See Phase Transitions below.

## Application Form Lock (Conventioner sharp edge)

- **Applications are stored snake_case**, unlike markets and organizations, which are
  camelCased on write. The market foreign key is `market_id`, NOT `marketId`.
  `back-end/api/applications.py` is the single owner of the collection and every reader and
  writer must go through it. A writer that stored the market reference under any other key
  would silently disable the D9 lock below - the count would just return 0.
- **The D9 lock has one source of truth**: `application_form_lock_reason()` in
  `back-end/api/markets.py`. A market's application form is editable only in `draft` phase
  and only while no application exists for it; once an applicant has submitted, the form is
  frozen for good.
- **`Market.application_form` is server-owned on update.** `PUT /markets/<id>/application-form`
  is its only writer on an existing market; `update_market()` re-applies the stored form over
  whatever a market PUT body carried. Do not "fix" that by letting a market PUT write the form
  - it is what makes the lock unbypassable. `POST /markets` may carry a form, and it runs
  through the same validator.
- E2E reaches the locked state with `seedApplication()`
  (`front-end/e2e/helpers/seedApplication.ts`), which writes the document straight into Mongo
  via `mongosh`, because no applicant-facing submit endpoint exists yet.

## Market Document Keys (Conventioner sharp edge)

- **The back end refuses to boot** unless `migrations/migrate_market_keys.py` has recorded its
  marker in the `schema_migrations` collection. A dev Mongo volume created before the migration
  existed has no marker, so an existing stack hits this on first pull. The fix is the migration
  itself: `docker compose run --rm backend python migrations/migrate_market_keys.py`
  (`run`, not `exec` - the back end is crash-looping). Do not "fix" it by softening the check:
  it fails closed because an unmigrated market is invisible, not broken.
- **Market documents are stored camelCase, and that is the only spelling reads may name.**
  Every write camel-cases the whole document, so a hand-written filter on `organization_id`
  matches nothing. Anything touching a raw document or a Mongo filter goes through
  `back-end/market_documents.py` (`market_doc_field`/`market_doc_filter`/`market_doc_set`/
  `market_from_document`). Do not add a read-time fallback that accepts both spellings: writes
  only refresh the camelCase key, so a legacy key holds a value that is stale forever.
  `front-end/e2e/access-control.spec.ts` pins the visibility that depends on this: a
  snake_case filter in the org-scoped market query is exactly the bug that once hid every
  org member's markets, and the suite's positive assertions catch it.
- **Parse stored markets with `market_from_document()`**, never `Market(**snake_dict)`.
  `Market.phase` defaults to `draft`, so a raw parse silently mislabels every market written
  before the field existed. `phase_from_market_document()` (`back-end/datatypes.py`) is the one
  source of truth for that mapping, and `MarketsApi.load_market_context()` is the shared
  market + organization + permission load every endpoint should use.

## Phase Transitions (Conventioner sharp edge)

- **Every precondition for every phase transition lives in `back-end/guards.py`.** Adding or
  removing one is a one-file edit: the `POST /markets/<id>/transition` endpoint and the
  front-end `BlockerPanel.vue` are generic over the `PreconditionResult` wire shape and must
  stay that way. `_validate_registry()` runs at import and refuses to load tables that disagree,
  so a misspelled phase or a dropped entry invariant is a startup error, not a silent no-op.
- `Market.phase` is server-owned: `create_market()` stamps `draft`, `update_market()` re-applies
  the stored phase, and the transition endpoint is the only writer on an existing market.
- **`phase` is the single source of truth for the market lifecycle; `is_draft` is derived from
  it.** `Market.is_draft` is a Pydantic `@computed_field` (true iff `phase == draft`) and is
  never independently writable: no request body can set it, and it is recomputed from the stored
  phase on every write. Nothing reads the stored value for a market whose `phase` this build
  understands. It is still *persisted*, and every writer keeps it in agreement with `phase` (create stamps both,
  `update_market()` re-derives it from the stored phase, the transition endpoint sets both in one
  atomic update), purely because it is the fallback `phase_from_market_document()` drops to when
  `phase` is missing or unrecognized - a fallback that contradicted the phase would answer
  confidently and wrongly. The two endpoints that serve a raw document rather than a parsed
  `Market` re-stamp `isDraft` from the effective phase before responding.
- **Publishing a CSV market is the `draft` → `archived` transition** (no guards), fired by the
  Done button in `GenerateAssignmentView.vue`. It used to be a `PUT` of `isDraft: false`; that
  route is gone, and this transition is now the only way a CSV market leaves `draft`.
  A legacy published market (`phase: "draft"` + `isDraft: false`) reads back as a *draft*, since
  `draft` is a phase this build recognizes and takes at face value - hence the migration below.
- **No Mongo condition can answer "is this market published?"** `{"phase": {"$ne": "draft"}}`
  also matches a document with no `phase` - which is exactly what a legacy *draft* looks like -
  so a filter like that would put an unpublished market on a public check-in URL. The public
  slug lookup prunes with `non_draft_market_prefilter()` (`back-end/market_documents.py`) and
  makes the draft decision in Python via `phase_from_market_document()`. The prefilter prunes;
  it does not judge. Keep it that way.
- **`migrations/migrate_is_draft_consistency.py`** repairs documents whose `isDraft` and `phase`
  disagree, in *opposite* directions depending on which build wrote them: a market the old build
  published (`phase: "draft"` + `isDraft: false`) has its **phase** advanced to `archived` - its
  `isDraft` was the only publish signal it ever had, and confirming it as a draft would take a
  live market's public check-in URL off the air - while a market with a non-draft `phase` and a
  stale `isDraft: true` has its `isDraft` recomputed. Documents with **no** `phase` are left
  alone; they are `migrate_phase.py`'s to backfill.

## Security Hardening (PR 5a)

- **Invariant: a security control must never key on a variable whose default is the insecure value.**
  This is the root cause of both vulnerabilities this PR closes: `SECRET_KEY` fell back to a
  committed literal, and the CORS policy gated on `FLASK_ENV`, whose default (`development`) ran
  the permissive branch on every deployment.
- **There is no fallback signing secret anywhere in this repository** and there must never be one
  again - not even "for dev". A committed fallback is a published key. Deleting one is only half the
  job, because it stays readable in the history: `back-end/utils/configured_secret.py` is the single
  answer to "does this variable hold a secret?", and all three secrets (`SECRET_KEY`,
  `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`) ask it. An operator meeting the boot refusal has an
  incentive to paste the old literal back (a fresh key logs every organizer out; the old one does
  not), and that would clear the refusal while changing nothing.
- **A blank or published value is NOT a configured secret, and a truthy placeholder is worse than a
  blank.** Both are what a half-copied template looks like, and a check that keys on mere truthiness
  passes on `re_xxxxx` - so the boot check reported a configured deployment and the failure landed at
  request time instead (a captcha verified against a key Google never issued, a 500 per signup from
  Resend). `configured_secret()` therefore strips, and `is_published()` refuses every value this repo
  has printed where a secret goes plus anything shaped like one (a run of x's, a `your-` prefix), on
  a laptop as on a deployment. Add any future placeholder to that set; better, never let a doc or a
  template print a usable-looking key - **every env template in this repo ships blanks** (with
  `DISABLE_CAPTCHA`/`DISABLE_EMAIL` on) precisely so there is nothing to copy.
- **`ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL_DEV` is the ONLY escape hatch** for the five boot-time requirements
  (`SECRET_KEY`, `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`, `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SESSION_TYPE`).
  It defaults to OFF - the secure state is the one you get by forgetting. It does *not* excuse a
  published `SECRET_KEY`: the hatch exists so a process with **no** key can boot with a random one.
- **A boot requirement must defend something this branch actually serves.** Each of the five is
  reachable today: the session cookie, `POST /register`'s captcha, the organizer API's origin list,
  the mail that carries every verification link, reset link and OTP, and the store the session is
  kept in. Rate limiting and `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` were cut from this PR and land with the applicant
  endpoints they key on: a requirement with nothing behind it teaches operators to work around the
  check.
- **`FLASK_ENV` does not exist in this repository - nothing reads it, and nothing sets it.** It is
  gone from the Dockerfile, `docker-compose.yml` and the env templates, so the invariant is
  structural rather than aspirational: a variable nobody sets is a variable nobody can key on. Do not
  reintroduce it. The image used to export `development`, so anything keyed on it read the same on a
  deployment as on a laptop - that is how the CORS hole survived, and how `SESSION_TYPE` came to
  default to `filesystem` on serverless hosts that have no disk. `SESSION_TYPE` is therefore
  configuration with no default (`back-end/utils/session_storage.py`), and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is
  not configurable at all, because a `SameSite=None` cookie is only accepted by a browser when Secure.
- **`SESSION_TYPE=null` installs no session store.** flask-session has no `null` backend and raises
  on one; Flask's own interface signs the session into the cookie, which is the only store a
  serverless function has. Do not "fix" a `null` deployment by handing it to `Session(app)`.
- **The check is a check.** `check_public_endpoint_defenses()` reads configuration and returns it;
  `configure_public_endpoint_defenses()` is the only thing that touches the app. Keep them apart:
  flask-cors installs an `after_request` handler per call, so a check with side effects stacked one
  onto the live app every time anything asked it a question.
- **The required production environment is documented in `docs/RELEASING.md`** - keep that table
  in step with the boot check in `back-end/app.py`. `back-end/.env.example` is the local-development
  template and must boot as it stands (it sets the hatch); a placeholder that is *truthy* is worse
  than a blank, because the app takes it for a configured secret. A deploy doc that is wrong is worse
  than one that is missing, because it will be trusted.
- **Every secret is read from the environment when it is asked for, never captured at import.**
  `signing_secret()`, `verifiable_secret()` and `sendable_key()` all call `os.getenv` per call, so the
  boot check is a pure function of the environment rather than of the import order that produced it.
  Two of them used to read their key into a module global on the way up, and that one difference cost
  three separate bugs: a `.env` loaded afterwards was a `.env` nobody saw (hence the ordering rule
  `app.py` used to hold in a comment), `monkeypatch.delenv` on those variables was a silent no-op, and
  every test had to know which module attribute to patch instead - so a test that "cleared the secret"
  cleared nothing and passed only because the shell running it happened to hold no key. Do not
  reintroduce a module-level `os.getenv` for a secret. `resend.api_key` is set on the way into each
  send (`ready_mailer()`), for the same reason.
- **`back-end/.env` is read by `back-end/utils/env_file.py`, called on `app.py`'s first line** (before
  the imports below it build their Mongo clients). Nothing loaded that file before this PR (no
  `load_dotenv`, no `python-dotenv`), which was harmless only while the app booted regardless; with
  the five requirements in place, the developer who followed `docs/STARTUP.md` met a refusal naming
  the variable they had just set. The real environment wins (`override=False`): the Docker stack
  bind-mounts `back-end/` into the container, so a stray `.env` must never be able to hand a process
  an escape hatch or a signing key it did not choose. **The test suite reads no `.env` at all** -
  `tests/conftest.py` points `utils.env_file.ENV_FILE` at a path that does not exist, because two test
  modules import `app`, and a suite whose result depends on an untracked file is green in CI and red
  on the laptop of anyone whose `.env` still carries what the old template printed.
  `test_the_local_development_template_boots_as_it_stands`
  (`tests/test_public_endpoint_defenses.py`) runs the shipped template through the real boot check, so
  an edit that pins an origin or reinstates a placeholder fails there rather than on a laptop.
- **`VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` is the other half of `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`, and it is a *build-time*
  requirement.** Making the back-end secret mandatory is what made it load-bearing: a bundle with no
  site key sends a placeholder token (`front-end/src/utils/captcha.ts`), which a back end with no
  secret used to wave through and a back end with a real one hands to Google, who never issued it - so
  every organizer signup 400s on a deployment that looks healthy. `vite build` therefore refuses a
  bundle without it (`front-end/vite.config.ts`), with the same opt-in escape hatch by the same name
  (`VITE_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL_DEV`). A defense that exists on only one side of the wire is not one.
