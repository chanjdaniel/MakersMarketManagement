# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Branch Model

- `dev` is the default/integration branch: all feature PRs target `dev`.
- `main` is the deploy-only branch: it auto-deploys, and is reached ONLY by promoting `dev` → `main` as a deliberate, versioned release.
- Never commit directly to `main`. Never open PRs targeting `main` (except the release-please Release PR, which is automated).

## Release Process

- Release management uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) (GitHub Action `googleapis/release-please-action@v5`).
- Release type is `simple` (conventional-commits-driven; no per-language package file parsing).
- Workflow triggers on push to `main` (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`).
- When `dev` is promoted to `main`, release-please opens a Release PR with version bump + CHANGELOG.
- Merging the Release PR creates a git tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`) and a GitHub Release.
- All commits MUST follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.).
- Baseline seed: `0.0.0` in `.release-please-manifest.json`, so the first `dev` → `main` promotion produces `v0.1.0`.
- Full release docs: `docs/RELEASING.md`.

## Tech Stack

- Front-end: Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript (in `front-end/`), PrimeVue UI components, Pinia state management.
- Back-end: Python 3.11 / Flask + MongoDB (in `back-end/`).
- Testing: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e) for front-end; pytest for back-end.
- CI: `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs on `dev` and `main` for both PRs and pushes.
