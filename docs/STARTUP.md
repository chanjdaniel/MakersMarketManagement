# Conventioner - Development Startup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the Conventioner application for development.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (recommended - see Docker Setup below)
  - OR **Python 3.8+**, **Node.js 18+**, and **MongoDB** (for local development)

## Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

1. **Start all services**:
  ```bash
   docker-compose up
  ```
2. **Access the application**:
  - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
  - Backend API: [https://localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000)
  - MongoDB: localhost:27017
3. **Stop all services**:
  ```bash
   docker-compose down
  ```
4. **View logs**:
  ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f [service_name]  # e.g., backend, frontend, mongodb
  ```
5. **Rebuild after code changes**:
  ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
  ```

That's it! The Docker setup handles all dependencies automatically.

## Local Development Setup (Without Docker)

If you prefer to run services locally without Docker:

```

## Step 1: MongoDB Setup

The application requires MongoDB to be running. The backend connects to:

- **Host**: `localhost:27017` (or `mongodb` in Docker)
- **Database**: `conventioner`
- **Authentication**: `admin:secret` (default development credentials)

### Option A: Local MongoDB Installation

1. Install MongoDB Community Edition:
  ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install mongodb
   # macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install mongodb-community

   # Or download from https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
  ```
2. Start MongoDB:
  ```bash
   # Linux
   sudo systemctl start mongod

   # macOS
   brew services start mongodb-community

   # Or manually
   mongod --dbpath /path/to/data/directory
  ```
3. Create admin user (if not already created):
  ```bash
   mongosh
   use admin
   db.createUser({
     user: "admin",
     pwd: "secret",
     roles: [ { role: "root", db: "admin" } ]
   })
  ```

### Option B: Docker MongoDB (Quick Setup)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mongodb \
  -p 27017:27017 \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin \
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
  mongo:latest
```

## Step 2: Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
  ```bash
   cd back-end
  ```
2. Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):
  ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
3. Install Python dependencies:
  ```bash
   pip install flask flask-session flask-login flask-bcrypt flask-cors pymongo pydantic
  ```
   Or if you have a `requirements.txt`:
4. Create necessary directories:
  ```bash
   mkdir -p flask_session csv_exports
  ```
5. Initialize the database:
  ```bash
   python init_database.py
  ```
   This creates the collections and records the market-key migration marker.
   The back end refuses to boot without that marker (see Troubleshooting below), and a MongoDB you started yourself has never run `back-end/mongo-init.js`, which is what records it for the Docker stack.
   Re-running it is harmless.

## Step 3: Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
  ```bash
   cd front-end
  ```
2. Install Node.js dependencies:
  ```bash
   npm install
  ```
3. Configure environment variables:
  Create or verify `.env` file in `front-end/` directory:
   Note: The frontend uses Vite's proxy to forward `/api` requests to the backend.

## Step 4: Running the Application

### Terminal 1: Start MongoDB (if not running as a service)

```bash
# If using Docker
docker start mongodb

# Or start MongoDB service
sudo systemctl start mongod  # Linux
brew services start mongodb-community  # macOS
```

### Terminal 2: Start Backend Server

```bash
cd back-end

# Activate virtual environment if using one
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Run Flask with HTTPS (adhoc certificate)
flask run --cert=adhoc

# Or redirect errors to log file
flask run --cert=adhoc > error.log 2>&1
```

The backend will start on: **[https://127.0.0.1:5000](https://127.0.0.1:5000)**

**Note**: The app uses HTTPS with an adhoc (self-signed) certificate. Your browser will show a security warning - this is expected in development. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to 127.0.0.1" to continue.

### Terminal 3: Start Frontend Development Server

```bash
cd front-end
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on: **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** (or another port if 5173 is busy)

## Step 5: Access the Application

1. Open your browser and navigate to: **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**
2. Accept the SSL certificate warning if prompted (for the backend HTTPS connection)
3. You should see the login page

## Step 6: Testing the Application

> **Automated test suites and a one-command seed fixture are documented in [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md).**
> For a ready-to-use test environment (Docker stack + test users + test organization + seeded market + sample CSV), run `./scripts/seed_fixture.sh` from the repository root.

### Create a Test User

You can register a user via the UI or using curl:

```bash
curl -k -X POST https://127.0.0.1:5000/register-user \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpassword",
    "organizations": [],
    "markets": []
  }'
```

### Basic Workflow Test

1. **Login**: Use the credentials you just created
2. **Create Organization**: Open "Organizations" and create one. Every market belongs to an organization, so a brand-new user must do this before they can create a market. The new-market form links here when you have no organizations.
3. **Create Market**: Click "New Market", select the organization, and fill in the market details. Submission stays disabled until an organization is selected.
4. **Upload CSV**: Upload a vendor CSV file with columns like:
  - Email
  - Vendor name
  - Market date preferences
  - Table preferences
  - Other vendor attributes
5. **Configure Market Setup**:
  - Select columns to include
  - Set up market dates
  - Configure tiers, locations, and sections
  - Set assignment priorities
6. **Generate Assignment**: Click "Assign" to run the assignment algorithm
7. **View Results**: Review the assignment statistics and vendor assignments

### Discord Webhook Setup

The market owner can post the assignment summary to a Discord channel via a per-market webhook URL.

1. In Discord, open the target server and go to **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks**.
2. Click **New Webhook**, choose the destination channel, optionally rename the webhook, then click **Copy Webhook URL**.
3. In Conventioner, open the market in **Market Setup** and paste the URL into the **Discord webhook URL** field. The URL is saved with the market on the next save action.
4. After running an assignment, open **Assignment Results** and click **Send to Discord**. The summary (assignments, vendors, tables, satisfaction, top sections, unassigned counts) is posted to the configured channel.

The webhook URL is stored per-market and treated as a secret; it is never logged. Leaving the field blank disables the **Send to Discord** button.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

**Services won't start**:

```bash
# Check if ports are already in use
docker-compose ps
lsof -i :5000  # Check port 5000
lsof -i :5173  # Check port 5173
lsof -i :27017 # Check port 27017

# Remove old containers
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f
```

**MongoDB connection errors in Docker**:

- Ensure MongoDB container is healthy: `docker-compose ps`
- Check MongoDB logs: `docker-compose logs mongodb`
- Wait for MongoDB to be fully initialized (healthcheck passes)

**Backend can't connect to MongoDB**:

- Verify MongoDB service name is `mongodb` in docker-compose.yml
- Check environment variables in docker-compose.yml
- Ensure both services are on the same network

**Frontend can't connect to backend**:

- Verify backend is running: `docker-compose logs backend`
- Check VITE_BACKEND_URL environment variable
- Ensure proxy configuration in vite.config.ts is correct

**Rebuild after dependency changes**:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

**Backend exits at startup with "The market-key migration has not been applied to this database"**:

The back end refuses to boot against a database whose market documents may still be stored under the legacy snake_case keys, because it reads the canonical camelCase key only - an unmigrated market would simply be invisible, with nothing logged.
A Mongo volume created before the migration existed has no marker, so an existing dev stack hits this the first time it pulls the change.
The migration is the whole fix: it runs against an existing database, rewrites the documents, and records the marker itself.

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend python migrations/migrate_market_keys.py
docker compose up backend
```

Use `run`, not `exec`: the back-end container is crash-looping, so there is nothing to attach to.
`run` starts a throwaway container (with MongoDB already up as its dependency) and passes the command straight through the entrypoint.
Add `--dry-run` to the migration to preview the changes without applying them.

**A market you published before now reads as a draft: its check-in URL 404s, and opening it drops you back into the setup wizard**:

The market lifecycle is now driven by `phase`, and every read derives the market's state from it.
Publishing used to be a `PUT` of `isDraft: false`, which never moved the phase - so a market published by the older build sits at `phase: "draft"` with `isDraft: false`.
`draft` is a phase this build recognizes, so it is taken at face value and the market reverts to looking unpublished: the public slug lookup, which serves markets past `draft` only, returns `404`, and the SPA routes the organizer to market setup instead of the market's public page.
The migration advances those markets to `archived`, resolving the disagreement in favour of `isDraft` (on those documents it was the only publish signal that existed):

```bash
docker compose exec backend python migrations/migrate_is_draft_consistency.py
```

Unlike the market-key migration this one does not gate boot, so nothing forces it - run it against any database with markets predating the change.
It is idempotent, and `--dry-run` previews the changes without applying them.

### Backend Issues

**MongoDB Connection Error**:

- Verify MongoDB is running: `mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"`
- Check connection configuration in `back-end/db_config.py`
- Environment variables (or defaults): `MONGODB_HOST`, `MONGODB_PORT`, `MONGODB_USER`, `MONGODB_PASSWORD`
- Default: `mongodb://admin:secret@localhost:27017/admin`

**Port 5000 Already in Use**:

```bash
# Find process using port 5000
lsof -i :5000  # macOS/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :5000  # Windows

# Kill the process or use a different port
flask run --cert=adhoc --port=5001
```

**SSL Certificate Warnings**:

- This is expected with `--cert=adhoc`. The browser will show a warning - accept it for development.

**Session Folder Missing**:

```bash
cd back-end
mkdir -p flask_session
```

### Frontend Issues

**Cannot Connect to Backend**:

- Verify backend is running on `https://127.0.0.1:5000`
- Check `front-end/vite.config.ts` proxy configuration
- Verify `.env` file has `VITE_FLASK_HOST=/api`

**Port 5173 Already in Use**:

- Vite will automatically use the next available port
- Check the terminal output for the actual port number

**CORS Errors**:

- The back end answers credentialed requests only from the origins in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. `docker-compose.yml` leaves it empty and sets `ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL_DEV`, which allows any loopback origin (`localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, any port) - so a front end served from anywhere else needs its origin listed
- Running the back end outside `docker-compose` means setting one of the two yourself; without either it refuses to boot, and the log says so

### MongoDB Issues

**Authentication Failed**:

- Verify admin user exists: `mongosh -u admin -p secret --authenticationDatabase admin`
- Or recreate the admin user (see Step 1)

**Database Not Found**:

- Databases are created automatically on first use
- Verify MongoDB is running and accessible

## Development Notes

### Docker Services

The `docker-compose.yml` defines three services:

1. **mongodb**: MongoDB database
  - Port: `27017`
  - Data persisted in Docker volume `mongodb_data`
  - Credentials: `admin:secret`
2. **backend**: Flask API server
  - Port: `5000` (HTTPS with adhoc certificate)
  - Hot-reload enabled via volume mount
  - Sessions and CSV exports persisted in volumes
3. **frontend**: Vue 3 development server
  - Port: `5173`
  - Hot-reload enabled via volume mount
  - Proxies `/api` requests to backend

### Environment Variables

**Backend** (set in docker-compose.yml):

- `MONGODB_HOST`: MongoDB service name (default: `mongodb`)
- `MONGODB_PORT`: MongoDB port (default: `27017`)
- `MONGODB_USER`: MongoDB username (default: `admin`)
- `MONGODB_PASSWORD`: MongoDB password (default: `secret`)

**Frontend** (set in docker-compose.yml):

- `VITE_FLASK_HOST`: API base path (default: `/api`)
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL`: Backend URL for Vite proxy (default: `https://backend:5000`)

### Vision AI Setup (Optional)

The floorplan feature includes AI-powered auto-detection of table placements. This is **optional** — the floorplan editor works without these keys, but the automatic table detection feature will be disabled.

1. **Gemini API Key**: Visit [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), sign in with your Google account, and click **Create API Key**. Copy the key and set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env`.
2. **OpenAI API Key**: Visit [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), sign in, and click **Create new secret key**. Copy the key and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your `.env`.

Both keys are configured in `.env` and forwarded to the backend via `docker-compose.yml`. If neither key is set, the AI auto-detection button is hidden in the UI and the floorplan editor behaves as a manual layout tool.

### Backend Structure

- **API Routes**: Defined in `back-end/app.py`
- **API Modules**: `back-end/api/` (users, markets, source_data)
- **Assignment Logic**: `back-end/assignment/assignment.py`
- **Data Types**: `back-end/datatypes.py` (Pydantic models)
- **Phase Guards**: `back-end/guards.py` (every precondition for every market phase transition)
- **Market Documents**: `back-end/market_documents.py` (the canonical keys stored market documents use, and the migration marker the app boots on)
- **Database Config**: `back-end/db_config.py` (MongoDB connection)

### Frontend Structure

- **Views**: `front-end/src/views/`
- **Components**: `front-end/src/components/`
- **API Client**: `front-end/src/utils/api.ts`
- **Router**: `front-end/src/router/index.ts`

### Important Files

- **Backend Config**: `back-end/app.py` (Flask app configuration)
- **Frontend Config**: `front-end/vite.config.ts` (Vite proxy settings)
- **Environment**: `front-end/.env` (Frontend environment variables)
- **Docker Compose**: `docker-compose.yml` (Service orchestration)

### CSV Export Location

- Assignment CSV files are saved to: `back-end/csv_exports/`
- Files are named: `{market_name}_assigned.csv`
- In Docker: Persisted in volume `backend_csv`

### Generate Shared Market Contract

Use the schema utility to regenerate the backend/frontend contract declaration directly from backend Pydantic contract types.

1. Run from the repository root:
  ```bash
   python back-end/generate_market_schema.py \
     --output docs/schema.d.ts
  ```
2. The generated contract will be written to:
  - `docs/schema.d.ts`

### Discord Webhook Setup (per market)

The Conventioner UI lets a market owner post the assignment summary to a Discord channel. No bot or token is required — Conventioner uses incoming webhooks.

1. In Discord, open the target server → **Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook**.
2. Pick the channel that should receive the assignment summary, click **Copy Webhook URL**.
3. In Conventioner, open the market → **Market Setup → Discord webhook URL** field → paste the URL → save.
4. From **Assignment Results**, click **Send to Discord** to post the summary. The webhook URL is stored per market and is not part of the global `.env`.

Webhook URLs are sensitive — anyone with the URL can post to the channel. Treat them like a password and rotate via Discord if leaked.

## Next Steps

Once the application is running:

1. Review the [TODO.md](./TODO.md) for remaining features
2. Check the codebase for implementation details
3. Explore the API endpoints via the browser dev tools Network tab
4. Test the assignment algorithm with sample vendor data
