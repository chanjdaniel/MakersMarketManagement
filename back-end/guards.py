"""Centralized guard registry for market phase transitions (D16).

Every precondition for every phase transition lives in this single file.
Each guard bundles its ``id``, ``description``, and ``evaluate()`` method.
Adding or removing a precondition edits ONLY this file -- the endpoint and
frontend never change.

Design: guards are plain Python classes, not a rules engine (D16 refined).
No ABC, no DSL, no runtime mutation. Read this file to understand every
precondition in the system.

Phase 1 guards implemented:
  - ``FormHasFieldsGuard``  on every edge into ``applications_open``
    (``draft -> applications_open`` and ``applications_closed -> applications_open``)

Phase 2 guards implemented (conv-market-state-machine-t7):
  - ``AllApplicationsReviewedGuard`` on ``review -> assignment``
  - ``NoApprovedApplicationsGuard`` on ``assignment -> offers``
