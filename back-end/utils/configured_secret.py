"""What counts as a configured secret, for every secret this app refuses to boot without.

A secret is a value only the deployment holds. Two shapes of value are not that, and both arrive by
the same route - an operator who copied a template and did not finish filling it in:

* A **blank** one. ``FOO=`` and ``FOO="   "`` are the shape a forgotten variable takes in a ``.env``
  file, and a check that reads the raw value takes the second for a configured secret.
* A **published placeholder**. Every value in ``PUBLISHED_VALUES`` has been printed in this
  repository - in an env template, in the deploy guide, or (for the signing key) as a committed
  fallback - so each is readable by anyone who can read the repo, which is the one thing a secret
  may not be.

The placeholder is the worse of the two, because it is *truthy*: a check that asks only whether the
variable is set passes, and the failure lands later and elsewhere - reCAPTCHA verifying every signup
against a key Google never issued, Resend rejecting ``re_xxxxx`` while the new account rolls back
behind a 500, and, for the signing key, no failure at all and every session forgeable. A check that
can be satisfied with garbage is not a check. Neither shape counts as configured here, so the
failure lands at boot with the variable named instead.

The shape rules are there because the literal list cannot be complete: the placeholder somebody
writes into a template tomorrow is one nobody has added here yet. A run of x's and a ``your-`` prefix
are what every placeholder in this repository's history looks like, and a generated key looks like
neither - four x's in a row is a one-in-a-million accident in a random 32-character key, and the
refusal tells its holder to generate another.
