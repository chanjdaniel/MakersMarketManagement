"""
reCAPTCHA v3 verification utility.

The bypasses below exist so a developer can run the stack without Google credentials, and every one
of them is scoped to a process that has explicitly said it is a local development one. A captcha
that disappears when it is not configured is not a control: the endpoint that carries it - organizer
signup - is public, unauthenticated, and it writes a user document and sends mail from this domain,
so a deployment with no secret would serve it wide open and say nothing about it. Anything that is
not an opted-in local dev process therefore refuses -- at boot, through
``assert_captcha_configured``, so the refusal names the variable rather than arriving as a mystery
400 on a caller's screen, and again here, so no caller reaches a verification this process cannot
actually perform.

The escape hatch is ``ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL_DEV`` and nothing else. It is deliberately *not*
``FLASK_ENV``: see ``utils.deployment``.
