"""The key every session cookie in this product is signed with.

A signing secret with a fallback is not a secret. The fallback that used to live here was a literal
committed to this repository, so on any deployment that forgot ``SECRET_KEY`` the key protecting the
product was a string anyone could read off the source: a Flask session cookie naming any organizer
could be minted at will and spent against the organizer API - every market, vendor and application
that organizer can reach - with no password and no login.

So there is no fallback. ``SECRET_KEY`` is required, it is checked at boot alongside the other
public-endpoint defenses, and the refusal names the variable -- the same shape as the reCAPTCHA
secret and the origin list, and for the same reason: a security control keyed on a variable whose
default is the insecure value is not a control.

Removing the fallback is only half of it, because the fallback is still readable - in this
repository's history, and in every deployment currently signing with it. An operator meeting the new
boot refusal has an incentive pointing straight back at it: a fresh key logs out every organizer, and
the old literal does not. Pasting it into ``SECRET_KEY`` would clear the refusal and change nothing
at all, so the values this repository has ever published are refused by name. A published value is
not a secret, whoever typed it in and wherever they typed it.

A short key is refused for the neighbouring reason: it is not a secret either, it is a guess away
from one, and the check exists to say so before the deployment does.

The local-development escape hatch (see ``utils.deployment``) does not restore a fallback either. It
mints a *random* secret for the life of the process, which is the part that matters: a value nobody
can predict cannot be forged against, and a value that changes every boot cannot quietly become the
key a deployment ships with. The cost is that a restart invalidates the sessions that process issued,
which is the correct price for a machine that has declined to configure a key.
