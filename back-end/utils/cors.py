"""Which browser origins this deployment lets spend an organizer's session cookie.

CORS with ``supports_credentials=True`` is what decides who may make a request that *carries the
organizer's session*, and this product's session cookie is ``SameSite=None``, so the browser attaches
it to cross-site XHR. Configured with no origin list, flask-cors reflects whatever ``Origin`` the
caller sent back in ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin`` and pairs it with
``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`` - which is every website on the internet reading and
writing the organizer API, including the applications collection, as whichever organizer happens to
be visiting it.

So the origin list is configuration, not a default, and there is no wildcard: a credentialed wildcard
is not a permissive setting, it is the absence of the control. ``CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`` is the
comma-separated list of origins that may do it, and a process that has not been told refuses to boot,
naming the variable - the same shape as the reCAPTCHA secret, the signing secret, and the
trusted-hop count, and for the same reason: this used to be keyed on ``FLASK_ENV != "production"``,
and the repo's own image sets ``FLASK_ENV=development``, so every deployment built from it served the
reflect-any-origin branch. A security control keyed on a variable whose default is the insecure value
is not a control.

The local-development escape hatch (see ``utils.deployment``) does not restore the wildcard either.
It allows *loopback* origins on any port - which is what a dev machine and the e2e stack actually
need, since the Vite port moves per worktree - and nothing else. An attacker's page is not served
from the developer's loopback, so this is an origin list too; it is just one nobody had to type.
