"""The key convention raw market documents are stored under.

Every market write camel-cases the whole document (``convert_keys_to_camel_case`` in
``create_market`` and ``update_market``), so ``organization_id`` is persisted as
``organizationId``. camelCase is the one canonical spelling: documents written before that
convention used snake_case, and ``migrations/migrate_market_keys.py`` rewrites them, so no
stored document carries both spellings and no read has to guess.

Tolerating both spellings at read time does not converge - a write only ever refreshes the
camelCase key, so a legacy snake_case key keeps its value forever and any filter that still
matches it keeps acting on stale data (an organization a market was moved away from would go
on seeing it). The data is normalized once instead, and readers name one key.

Code that goes through ``convert_keys_to_snake_case`` (``load_market_context``) never has to
think about this. Code that touches a raw document or writes a Mongo filter does, and it uses
these helpers rather than a string literal, so the spelling is decided in exactly one place.

Reading one key only means the data has to be normalized first, and nothing auto-runs the
migration: rewriting stored documents is a deliberate operator action. The migration records a
marker document in ``schema_migrations`` when it completes, and the app refuses to boot unless
that marker is there (``assert_market_key_migration_recorded``, called from ``app.py``).
Serving unmigrated data would hide markets from the check-in lookup and from org-scoped lists
with no error anywhere; a loud refusal at startup is the only failure mode that cannot be
deployed by accident. The marker is a single document read by ``_id``, so the check is one
indexed lookup rather than a scan over every market - cheap enough to fail closed on, which is
what it does: an unknown migration state is not a migrated one.

    A candidate with no ``id`` is skipped rather than re-fetched: ``find_one({"id": None})`` is not
    a lookup that misses, it is a filter that matches every document whose ``id`` is null *or
    absent*, so it would answer with some other market entirely and that market's name is never
