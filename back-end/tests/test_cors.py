"""Which websites may spend an organizer's session cookie, and what happens when nobody has said.

The session cookie is ``SameSite=None``, so the browser attaches it to cross-site XHR, and the API
answers with ``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true``. The origin list is therefore the whole of
the control: with no list, flask-cors reflects the caller's own ``Origin`` back at it, and every
website an organizer visits can read and write the organizer API as them.
