"""The slug is stored, derived, and server-owned - because it is a market's public identifier.

Every public URL a market appears on names it by the slug of its name, and every endpoint behind
those URLs is unauthenticated: public check-in, the application form, applicant sign-in. The slug
is persisted so that lookup is one indexed query (``published_market_by_slug``) instead of a decode
of every market in the database that any stranger could drive by typing a URL.

Persisting a derived value is only safe while nothing can leave it disagreeing with what it was
derived from. That is what these pin: it is a computed field, so every write recomputes it from the
name, and no request body can name it.
