"""The local-development template has to be a file the process actually reads.

``docs/STARTUP.md`` tells a developer to copy ``.env.example`` to ``.env``, and until this was wired
up nothing loaded it - so every variable in it was set in a file the back end never opened. That was
invisible while the app booted anyway; with the five boot requirements in place it means the
documented onboarding path ends in a refusal naming the variable the developer has already set.

The one process that must *not* read that file is this one. Two test modules import ``app``, whose
first line loads it, so an untracked file on the machine running the suite would otherwise decide
what the suite sees - and the ``.env`` a developer already holds was written from the *old* template,
which printed a published placeholder for all three secrets. ``conftest.py`` therefore points
``ENV_FILE`` at a path that does not exist, which works only because it is read on each call rather
than bound as a default argument. The last test here is what keeps that true.
