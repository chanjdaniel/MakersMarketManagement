"""The essential application-form questions: the answers the assignment solver reads directly.

Every application form asks these, whatever else the organizer builds. If the assignment
algorithm reads it, it is essential - that test is mechanical, and five fields pass it:

  - email                    -- the applicant's identity; captured at sign-in, not asked here
  - essential_available_dates -- which market dates the applicant CAN attend (capability)
  - essential_max_dates       -- at most how many dates they WANT (appetite; not capability)
  - essential_section_ranking -- section preference, best first
  - essential_table_type_ranking -- table type preference, best first

This module is the single owner of that contract: the reserved answer keys, the derivation of
what the questions offer, the validation of an applicant's answers, and the freeze that stops
the offering from moving under recorded answers.

The offering is never an independent list: it is the market plan itself. Dates come from
``SetupObject.market_dates``, sections from ``SetupObject.sections``, and table types from the
market's floorplan (the latest saved one - ``floorplans_save`` overwrites ``sections`` and
``locations`` from the latest floorplan too, so its table types are the current plan's).

Freeze semantics (the D9 principle extended to the offering): while no applicant has recorded
an answer, the offering follows the market plan live - an organizer edits their plan and the
form follows. The moment the first answer is stored, the offering it was validated against is
persisted onto ``applicationForm.essentialOptions`` (camelCase, like the whole market document)
and every later read serves that snapshot, so an applicant can never have answered a question
that moved. There is deliberately no way to refresh it afterwards.
