"""Applicant-facing application endpoints and organizer monitoring endpoints.

The applicant read path and the organizer review/monitoring path are in one module because they
share the same publication gate: ``applicant_visible_status`` is the one place that decides what
an applicant sees, and the organizer endpoints bypass it so the organizer always sees the truth.

Publication gate (captain ruling 2026-07-13):
    An applicant may sign in during any phase and always see their own submitted application.
    ``reviewer_approved`` / ``reviewer_rejected`` outcomes are HIDDEN from the applicant until
    the organizer explicitly PUBLISHES results. Until publication, the applicant sees a neutral
    ``under_review`` state - never the verdict.

    An organizer must not leak a half-finished review, and must retain the ability to change their
    mind before any applicant sees an outcome. Publication is the single, deliberate,
    organizer-controlled moment the verdict becomes visible.

    The enforcement lives on the BACKEND in ``applicant_visible_status``. No client-side hiding
    is sufficient: a verdict present in the API response is an information leak in the page markup,
    the same class of bug as the login oracle closed in 5d.
